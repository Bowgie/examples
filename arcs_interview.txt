Connecting to CoS SSH jumphost

We recently upgraded our ssh jumphost from rhel 7 to rhel 9, which may cause you to recieve about a mismatched key.

You will need to generate a new ssh key using the ssh-keygen command.

First, open your terminal.

You can do this in rhel by hitting:
CTRL + ALT + T
At the same time.

Then run the command:
ssh-keygen

This generates a key, and asks for the file in which to store the private key.
The public key is stored in a file with the same name but with .pub at the end.
The private key you never share, while the public key can be shared freely.

It will then ask to make a passphrase.
Similar to a password, but a passphrase can be series of words, punctuations, numbers, whitespace, or any string of characters you want.
A good passphrase is between 10 - 30 characters long.


When trying to connect to the jumphost:
ssh user@cos.gatech.edu -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 


If you want to add this to your ssh config you can add:

# ~/.ssh/config
Host cos
  Hostname cos.gatech.edu
  User user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
